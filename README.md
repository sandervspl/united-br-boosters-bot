# united-br-boosters-bot

This Discord bot was created to keep track of cross-realm PvP bracket boosting.

## How it worked

Each server had its own channel to keep track of the boosted characters

Admins from the other realms would then say how many characters were boosted. Every admin had a realm attached to them.
